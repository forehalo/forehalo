ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Liu Yi.

I previously worked at AFFiNE, an open source collaboration editor built with [CRDT](https://crdt.tech). I worked for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.cn/) and [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/) before.

By leading AFFiNE Dev Team, and meanwhile, porting [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) with Rust to [y-octo](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-octo), I'm experienced at building large collaborative application.

As co-creator of [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs), I introduced the procedure marco `#[napi]`, lowering the barrier of binding Rust crate to Node.js native addon and WASI.

More previously, I created [Perfsee](https://github.com/perfsee/perfsee), an analyzer helps you measuring your bundles and performance of your web applications, which inspires [rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.rs/).
